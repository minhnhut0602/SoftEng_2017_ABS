Daniel Caddaye on JUnit Tests for Menu Class
@sohumraut1 I've merged this with master so you can see how the menu test works. If you do a different console print layout then adjust the test beforehand.

The two test cases that are done are enough for you to get started on the menu.

I will do some more test cases soon but you should try and code some also.

Sohum Raut on JUnit Tests for Menu Class
Create new JUnit test in Eclipse using the Wizard for Menu Class and remerge to Github as a Java file. Eg MenuTest.java.

Write tests to check if the Menu Displays correctly
Look out how to test Print Statements / Print Lines
Test to make sure the Menu Displays as shown in the Mock Up.
